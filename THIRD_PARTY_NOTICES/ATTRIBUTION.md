# Attribution — Streamlit Stockpeers demo

This docs pack includes a Streamlit theme configuration file:

- `.streamlit/config.toml`

The values are taken from the Streamlit demo app **Stockpeers**:
- Repo: `streamlit/demo-stockpeers`
- File: `.streamlit/config.toml`

The upstream project is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**.
A copy of the license text is included in:
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES/STREAMLIT_DEMO_STOCKPEERS_LICENSE.txt`

Why include it?
- You requested that the next stage of `options-helper` emulate the look and feel (including theme) of Stockpeers.
- Streamlit themes are just config values, and using the same values is the most reliable way to match the vibe.

No other Stockpeers code is included in this pack.
