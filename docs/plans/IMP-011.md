# IMP-011 — Reporting UX (TUI dashboards / web UI)

- **Status:** draft
- **Effort:** M–L
- **Alpha potential:** Low

## Summary
Improve speed-of-review by adding a lightweight dashboard for the daily artifacts.

This does not create edge by itself, but it reduces friction and makes the daily loop more sustainable.

## Goals
- Provide a “daily briefing” view with sections for positions, monitor watchlist, and scanner shortlist.
- Make it easy to jump to: chain-report, compare, flow, derived stats.
- Keep the dashboard **read-only**; the source of truth remains the files under `data/reports/`.

## Non-goals
- Trading execution.
- A heavy web app with authentication (v1 stays local).

## Options (pick one for v1)
### Option A — Rich TUI (recommended)
- Use `rich` + simple key commands (or `textual` if desired) to render views.
- Pros: stays CLI-first, easy packaging.

### Option B — Static HTML bundle
- Render a small static site under `data/reports/site/` and open in the browser.
- Pros: great readability, no server required.

## Implementation plan
### Step 1 — Define the data contract to render
**Files:**
- `docs/REPORT_PACK.md`
- `docs/BRIEFING.md`

**Work:**
- Ensure the briefing JSON includes enough fields (or extend it) so the dashboard doesn’t need to parse markdown.

### Step 2 — Implement renderer
**Files:**
- `options_helper/ui/` (new)
- `options_helper/cli.py`

**Work:**
- Add command: `options-helper dashboard --date latest`.
- Load briefing JSON + related artifacts from `data/reports/...`.

### Step 3 — Tests
**Files:**
- `tests/test_dashboard.py` (new)

**Work:**
- Smoke test: command runs on fixture artifacts.

## Acceptance criteria
- You can open a single “daily” view and click/navigate to the underlying artifacts in <30 seconds.
